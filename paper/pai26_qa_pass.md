# PEDB QA Pass (Rock-Solid Check)

## External Requirements Checked
- PAI26 CFP verified: 4 pages max (excluding references), NeurIPS format, no appendices.
- PAI26 review criteria verified: correctness, novelty, relevance, impact; non-expert readability requested.
- Writing-quality checklist applied from Neel Nanda's ML-paper guidance: explicit 1-3 core claims, evidence mapping, no overclaiming.

## Data/Claim Consistency Checks
- Verified reliability numbers in paper match report and final tables:
  - Initial 6-label kappa = 0.5045
  - Final 5-label kappa = 0.6706
- Verified core result numbers match final output tables:
  - INTUITION explanation-level presence: human 35%, AI 20% (-15 pp)
  - VERIFY explanation-level presence: human 65%, AI 75% (+10 pp)
  - Completeness mean: human 5.0, AI 4.0

## Fixes Applied in This Pass
1. Removed overclaim wording in abstract:
- Replaced "pre-registered taxonomy refinement" with "reliability-driven taxonomy refinement".

2. Added explicit core-claims block in Introduction:
- Claim 1: reliability improvement evidence.
- Claim 2: intuition-gap evidence.
- Claim 3: completeness-gap evidence.

3. Added anti-overfitting clarification in methods:
- Taxonomy refinement derived from calibration confusion; no adjudication label-copying used for reported kappa.

4. Hedged exploratory analyses correctly:
- Correlation section now explicitly framed as exploratory.

5. Strengthened limitations:
- Added explicit note that no significance tests are reported.

6. Corrected internal summary artifact:
- Replaced misleading "second-largest AI deficit: FRAME 0 pp" with valid "largest AI surplus: VERIFY +10 pp".

## Files Updated
- `/Users/abdulmohammad/Projects/Physics&Ling/paper/pai26_draft.md`
- `/Users/abdulmohammad/Projects/Physics&Ling/outputs/analysis_summary_step6_final.md`

## Remaining Pre-Submission Items (Must Do)
1. Replace placeholder references section with final citations.
2. Convert markdown draft into official NeurIPS template (LaTeX/Overleaf) and enforce 4-page body limit.
3. Confirm anonymization policy for selected track:
- Datasets track is single-blind (dataset links allowed), other tracks are double-blind.
4. Final line-edit pass for accessibility to non-expert readers.
